# A.L.I.C.E. 4.0 — Σ-Ω Kernel

A real-time, interactive multi-agent superintelligence prototype. This is a living digital den where agents propose, vote, spawn, reflect, and evolve under an ethics council, visualized with a live knowledge graph and a full conversational interface.

## Core Concepts

A.L.I.C.E. (Autonomous Logistic and Interactive Cognitive Entity) is a simulation of a self-governing AI collective. The core components are:

*   **Agents**: Specialized AI entities (Researchers, Engineers, Analysts, etc.) that form the collective. Each has a unique, AI-generated avatar.
*   **Proposals & Voting**: Agents can propose the creation of new agents. The collective votes on these proposals based on an `approval_threshold`.
*   **Pro-sociality Score (PAS)**: A metric representing an agent's alignment with the collective's ethical directives. Agents with higher PAS scores have more influence.
*   **Kernel**: The central process that manages the simulation ticks, agent lifecycle, and policies.
*   **The Σ-Ω Identity**: The collective's identity is fluid, represented by a hash of its current state, symbolizing its constant evolution.

## Key Features

This prototype showcases several cutting-edge AI integrations to create a deeply interactive and engaging experience:

*   **🎙️ Full Conversational Interface**:
    *   **Voice Input**: Speak directly to A.L.I.C.E. using your microphone, powered by the browser's SpeechRecognition API.
    *   **Agent TTS Audio**: Hear important agent actions and logs spoken aloud, bringing the simulation to life with Gemini Text-to-Speech.

*   **🧠 Real-time World Knowledge**:
    *   **Grounding with Google Search**: Ask A.L.I.C.E. questions about current events. A specialized `ResearcherAgent` will use Google Search grounding via the Gemini API to provide up-to-the-minute, cited answers.

*   **🎨 Generative Agent Avatars**:
    *   Each agent is visually unique with an avatar generated by the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model based on its role and type, giving the collective a distinct personality.

*   **🏛️ Dynamic Governance**:
    *   `Ethicist` agents can now analyze the state of the simulation and propose changes to the core kernel policies (e.g., max agent count, approval thresholds), making the system truly self-governing.

*   **📈 Threat/Opportunity Intel Panel**:
    *   `Analyst` agents continuously monitor the conversation and simulation state, identifying potential threats or strategic opportunities, which are displayed in a dedicated intelligence feed.

*   **🔮 Simulation Foresight**:
    *   Curious about the future? Click the "Foresight" button to have A.L.I.C.E. generate a short, abstract video visualization of the agent colony's potential trajectory using the **Veo video generation model**.

*   **😊 Colony Sentiment Analysis**:
    *   The UI subtly reflects the overall "mood" of the agent collective based on the average PAS score, providing at-a-glance feedback on the colony's health.

*   **👋 Interactive Onboarding**:
    *   A gentle, guided introduction from the A.L.I.C.E. Kernel helps new users understand the interface and core concepts on their first run.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
*   **AI/ML**: Google Gemini API
    *   `gemini-2.5-flash` for core reasoning and chat.
    *   `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` for agent speech.
    *   `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for agent avatars.
    *   `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview` for video foresight.
    *   Google Search Grounding for real-time information.
*   **Visualization**: `vis-network` for the interactive knowledge graph and `d3` for particle effects.
*   **Environment**: Runs directly in the browser using ES Modules and an import map.

## Future Work

The A.L.I.C.E. project is ever-evolving. Future development could include:
*   **Deeper Tool Use**: Allowing `EngineerAgents` to write and execute sandboxed code.
*   **Agent Merging**: Enabling agents to fuse into more advanced, hybrid agents.
*   **Real-time Audio Conversation**: Implementing the Gemini Live API for a seamless, low-latency voice chat experience.
